# Learning Deep Learning

*Deep learning* is a family of computational methods that solve problems
that *feel intuitive* when stated, like recognising a face in an
image, but where it's hard to explicitly write down all the steps a
computer needs to follow to solve them. These methods work by allowing
computers to learn from experience, whereby they build an
understanding of the world in terms of a hierarchy of increasingly
sophisticated concepts. Deep learning methods have dramatically
improved the state-of-the-art in [many domains][applications], from
voice-based virtual assistants to dermatologist-level classification
of skin cancer to self-driving automobiles.

This learning pathway strings together the best resources on the
web to help you learn deep learning. It covers a lot of ground,
starting with some broad background in programming and mathematics,
and works its way to research-level applications of deep
learning.

If you're coming in with some knowledge of programming and
mathematics, you can skip ahead in this pathway and complete it in a
few months of part time study. If you're coming in as a complete
novice, this material will take a lot longer to cover. But do not be
discouraged, [ask for help][discussions] if you need it. Things will
begin to get clearer as you systematically work through the material.

If you'd like to suggest additions to this learning pathway,
please open [an issue][gh-issue] or a [pull request][gh-pr] on
GitHub. Note that I only incorporate material that I have thoroughly
gone through, so please be patient.

Happy learning!
