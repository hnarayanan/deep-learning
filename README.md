# Deep Learning

*Deep learning* is a family of computational methods that solve
problems that sound *intuitive* when stated, like recognising a face
in an image, but where it's hard to explicitly write down all the
steps a computer needs to follow to solve them. These methods work by
allowing computers to learn from experience, whereby they build an
understanding of the world in terms of a hierarchy of increasingly
sophisticated concepts. Deep learning methods have dramatically
improved the state-of-the-art in [many application
domains][applications]: from voice-based virtual assistants, to
dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer, to self-driving
automobiles.

This repository offers the following:

- A [systematic pathway to learn deep learning][learning],
  incorporating the best resources on the web.
- A clear guide through the [state of the art of deep learning
  applications][applications] across different domains.

It is a work in progress. Check back in frequently for updates.
