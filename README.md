# Learning Deep Learning

*Deep learning* is a family of computational methods that solve
problems that sound *intuitive* when stated, like recognising a face
in an image, but where it's hard to explicitly write down all the
steps a computer needs to follow to solve them. These methods work by
allowing computers to learn from experience, whereby they build an
understanding of the world in terms of a hierarchy of increasingly
sophisticated concepts. Deep learning methods have dramatically
improved the state-of-the-art in [many application
domains][applications]: from voice-based virtual assistants, to
dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer, to self-driving
automobiles.

This learning pathway strings together the best resources on the
web to help you learn deep learning. It covers a lot of ground,
starting with some broad background in programming and mathematics,
and works its way to research-level applications of deep
learning.

If you're coming in with some knowledge of programming and
mathematics, you can skip ahead in this pathway and complete it in a
few months of part time study. If you're coming in as a complete
novice, this material will take a lot longer to cover. But do not be
discouraged, [ask for help as you need it][discussions]. Things will
begin to get clearer as you systematically work through the material.

If you'd like to suggest additions or improvements to this learning
pathway, please open [an issue][gh-issue] or a [pull request][gh-pr]
on GitHub. Note that I only incorporate material that I have
thoroughly gone through, so please be patient.

Happy learning!

### Mathematics Basics

- Calculus
- Linear Algebra: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm
- Numerical Methods
- Probability and Information Theory

### Programming Basics

- Python
- Numerical Programming with Python and Numpy

### Machine Learning in General

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Before you jump to deep
learning, you might want to brush up on the broader fundamentals of
machine learning.

The ideal place to start for a beginner is the Machine Learning course
by Andrew Ng on Coursera. It is a gentle introduction to a variety of
topics without getting too bogged down in mathematical detail.

When you're done with this, you have a choice of two courses to pick
from. Both of the following offer additional insight by digging deeper
into the mathematics.
