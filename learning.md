# Learning Deep Learning

This learning pathway strings together the best free resources on the
web to help you learn deep learning. It covers a lot of ground,
starting with some broad background in programming and mathematics,
and works its way to research-level applications of deep learning.

If you're coming in with some knowledge of programming and
mathematics, you can skip ahead in this pathway and complete it in a
few months of study. If you're coming in as a complete novice, this
material will take a lot longer to cover. But do not be discouraged,
[ask for help as you need it][discussions]. Things will begin to get
clearer as you systematically work through the material.

If you'd like to suggest additions or improvements to this learning
pathway, please open [an issue][gh-issue] or a [pull request][gh-pr]
on GitHub. Note that I only incorporate material that I have
thoroughly gone through myself, so please be patient.

Happy learning!

### Mathematical Prerequisites

A good, undergraduate-level understanding of a few branches of
mathematics is essential for truly understanding machine learning
algorithms. This is especially true for deep learning algorithms. The
following courses offer excellent insights into these areas, and form
a solid base for you to begin your journey:

- Calculus
- [Linear Algebra][linear-algebra-course]
- Probability and Information Theory
- Numerical Methods

If you're already familiar with the any of the following topics, feel
free to skip the corresponding courses. Just note that these excellent
resources exist in case you want to return to brush up on concepts
later!

### Introduction to Programming

I have made a conscious (and opinionated) choice to focus this
learning pathway primarily around a programming language called
Python. Python is easy for newcomers to pickup, and is excellent both
for general purpose programming, as well as many specific domains
including deep learning.

If you're a newcomer to programming, you'll want to start from the
beginning:

- [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python][python-course]

This course will not only introduce you to Python, but also shows you
how to go about solving complex problems by decomposing them into
simpler sub-problems.

Once you're familiar with general-purpose programming with Python, I
suggest the following tutorial to get a sense of its use in numerical
programming:

- [Numerical Programming with Python and Numpy][python-numpy-tutorial]

### Machine Learning in General

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Before you jump to deep
learning, you might want to brush up on the broader fundamentals of
machine learning.

The ideal place to start for a beginner is the Machine Learning course
by Andrew Ng on Coursera. It is a gentle introduction to a variety of
topics without getting too bogged down in mathematical detail.

When you're done with this, you have a choice of two courses to pick
from. Both of the following offer additional insight by digging deeper
into the mathematics.
